# Files-FoldersRename
*Work in progress*
Python programs to rename files and folders. There are two separate .py files; one for renaming folders and the other for files.

The initial idea was to shorten paths in long folder structures in Windows, since there's a [maximum path length limitation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#paths) .

###### How does the renaming work?
The aim of these programs is to:
1. Read all keywords that are to be changed and their replaces from an Excel file.
2. To log all the changes that have been made on files and folders.
